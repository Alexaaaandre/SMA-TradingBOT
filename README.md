# SMA-TradingBOT

This Bot is coded using Python for the Quanconnect platform. 

The logic here is whenever the current price is above the monthly SMA and we are 5% of the highest price of the year, we considered that we are in an uptrend and we buy.

On the other hand, whenever the price is lower than the monthly SMA and we are close to the lowest price of the year we considered this a downtrend and we short.
